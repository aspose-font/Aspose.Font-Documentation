**Welcome to Aspose.Font for Java**

Aspose.Font is a Java font loading and drawing library. It supports multiple front formats such as TrueType (with TrueType collectons), CFF, OpenType, and Type1. The API provides rich functionality to load/save font and provide information about its data structures along with any glyph that is supported by all the font types. It also provides encoding information for all the font types which represents a mapping between character codes and glyph identifiers. Its rendering subsystem helps end-users to render any desired glyph or text. Special glyphs can be rendered by implementing interface using simple graphics functionality (move point, draw line, curve).
