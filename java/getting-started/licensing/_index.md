## **Evaluation Version Limitations**
We want our customers to test our components thoroughly before buying so the evaluation version allows you to use it as you would normally. Evaluation version of Aspose.Font (without a license specified) provides full product functionality except some evaluation limitations. An evaluation supports working with the following fonts only.

 * CFF
 * Type1 Fonts and Montserrat
 * Noto Sans JP
 * Merriweather
 * Lora
 * Source Code Pro
 * TTF Fonts

## **Apply License using File or Stream Object**
The license can be loaded from a file or stream object. The easiest way to set a license is to put the license file in the same folder as the aspose-font-xx.x.jar file and specify the filename, without a path, as shown in the example below.

### **Loading a License from File**
The easiest way to apply a license is to put the license file in the same folder as the Aspose.Font.jar file and specify just the filename without a path.

When you call the setLicense method, the license name that you pass should be that of your license file. For example, if you change the license file name to "Aspose.font.lic.xml" pass that filename to the com.aspose.font.License.setLicense(…) method. The license file can be specific for Aspose.Font for Java or you can use Aspose.Total for Java license file.
