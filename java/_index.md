**Welcome to Aspose.Font for Java**

Aspose.Font for Java is a font loading and drawing library. It supports multiple font formats such as TrueType (with TrueType collections), CFF, OpenType, and Type1. The API provides rich functionality to load/save fonts and provide information about its data structures along with any glyph that is supported by all the font types. It also provides encoding information for all the font types which represents a mapping between character codes and glyph identifiers. Its rendering subsystem helps end-users to render any desired glyph or text. Special glyphs can be rendered by implementing interfaces using simple graphics functionality (move point, draw line, curve).
