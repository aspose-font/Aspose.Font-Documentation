**Welcome to Aspose.Font for C++**

Aspose.Font for C++ is a font manipulation API which lets you work with several font formats. It provides the capability to load and save fonts from files as well as stream. The API lets you work with multiple font formats such as TrueType (with TrueType collections), CFF, OpenType, and Type1. It can read encoding information for all the font types for representation of mapping between character codes and glyph identifiers. C++ application developers can use the API to render any desired glyph or text. Special glyphs can be rendered by implementing interface using simple graphics functionality (move point, draw line, curve).
